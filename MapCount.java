/*  JFM1T13_Assignment3:

      Write a Java program to count the number of key-value (size) mappings in a map. 
      Prompt the user input from the terminal.

      Sample Input: 
      Enter value:20
      Enter key:bitLabs
      Enter another student (y/n)?y
      Enter value:25
      Enter key:welcomes
      Enter another student (y/n)?y
      Enter value:30 
      Enter key:you
      Enter another student (y/n)?n

      Expected Output: The size of the map is 3
